**Detailed Requirement Specifications for Key Backend Features**
This document provides detailed requirement specifications for three key backend features from the Airbnb Clone project: User Authentication (part of User Management), Property Management (Property Listings Management), and Booking System (Booking Management). These specifications are derived from the core functionalities, technical requirements, and non-functional requirements outlined in the project. Each feature includes:

API Endpoints: RESTful endpoints with HTTP methods.
Input/Output Specifications: JSON payloads for requests and responses.
Validation Rules: Data integrity and security checks.
Performance Criteria: Scalability, response times, and throughput expectations.

The backend is assumed to use Node.js/Express or similar, with PostgreSQL as the database, JWT for authentication, and integrations like Stripe for payments. All endpoints require proper error handling (e.g., 4xx/5xx responses) and logging.


**1. User Authentication**
This feature handles user registration, login, and authentication, ensuring secure access for guests, hosts, and admins. It uses JWT for session management and supports OAuth for third-party logins.
API Endpoints

POST /auth/register: Register a new user (guest or host).
POST /auth/login: Authenticate and log in a user.
POST /auth/oauth: Handle OAuth login (e.g., Google, Facebook).
GET /auth/refresh: Refresh JWT token (requires valid refresh token).

Input/Output Specifications

POST /auth/register:

Input (Request Body - JSON):
json{
  "email": "string" (required, unique email address),
  "password": "string" (required, min 8 characters),
  "role": "string" (required, enum: ["guest", "host"]),
  "firstName": "string" (optional),
  "lastName": "string" (optional),
  "phone": "string" (optional, valid phone format)
}

Output (Response Body - JSON, 201 Created):
json{
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "string",
    "role": "string",
    "firstName": "string",
    "lastName": "string",
    "phone": "string"
  },
  "token": "string" (JWT access token),
  "refreshToken": "string" (JWT refresh token)
}

Error Responses: 400 Bad Request (invalid input), 409 Conflict (email exists).


POST /auth/login:

Input (Request Body - JSON):
json{
  "email": "string" (required),
  "password": "string" (required)
}

Output (Response Body - JSON, 200 OK):
json{
  "user": { ... } (same as register),
  "token": "string",
  "refreshToken": "string"
}

Error Responses: 401 Unauthorized (invalid credentials).


POST /auth/oauth:

Input (Request Body - JSON): Provider-specific (e.g., {"provider": "google", "code": "string"}).
Output: Similar to login, with user data merged if existing.


GET /auth/refresh:

Input: Header with refresh token.
Output: New access token.



**Validation Rules**

Email must be unique (checked against Users table) and valid format (e.g., regex: ^[\w-.]+@([\w-]+.)+[\w-]{2,4}$).
Password must meet strength criteria: min 8 chars, at least one uppercase, lowercase, number, and special char; hashed with bcrypt before storage.
Role must be "guest" or "host" (admins created separately via dashboard).
For OAuth: Validate provider token with external API; prevent duplicate accounts by email merge.
All inputs sanitized to prevent SQL injection/XSS.
Rate limiting: Max 5 attempts per IP per 5 minutes to prevent brute-force attacks.

**Performance Criteria**

Average response time: < 200ms for login/register (measured under load).
Throughput: Handle 1,000 requests per minute without degradation.
Scalability: Use caching (Redis) for token validation; horizontal scaling via load balancers.
Security: All endpoints use HTTPS; tokens expire (access: 15min, refresh: 7 days).
Testing: 100% unit test coverage for validation; integration tests for JWT flow.

2. **Property Management**
This feature allows hosts to create, edit, and delete property listings, including details like location, amenities, and images. It ensures only authenticated hosts can manage their own listings.
API Endpoints

POST /properties: Create a new property listing (host only).
GET /properties/{id}: Retrieve a specific property.
PUT /properties/{id}: Update a property (host only, must own it).
DELETE /properties/{id}: Delete a property (host only, must own it).
GET /properties: List all properties (paginated, for search integration).

Input/Output Specifications

POST /properties:

Input (Request Body - JSON, Multipart for images):
json{
  "title": "string" (required, max 100 chars),
  "description": "string" (required, max 1000 chars),
  "location": "object" (required, { "address": "string", "city": "string", "country": "string", "lat": "number", "lng": "number" }),
  "pricePerNight": "number" (required, positive float),
  "amenities": "array<string>" (optional, e.g., ["Wi-Fi", "Pool"]),
  "availability": "array<object>" (optional, date ranges: { "start": "date", "end": "date" }),
  "maxGuests": "integer" (required, min 1),
  "images": "array<file>" (optional, uploaded files, max 10, each <5MB)
}

Output (Response Body - JSON, 201 Created):
json{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "location": { ... },
  "pricePerNight": "number",
  "amenities": ["string"],
  "availability": [{ ... }],
  "maxGuests": "integer",
  "images": ["string"] (cloud URLs, e.g., AWS S3),
  "hostId": "uuid"
}

Error Responses: 403 Forbidden (not host or unauthorized).


GET /properties/{id}:

Input: Path param id (uuid).
Output: Property object as above (200 OK).


PUT /properties/{id}:

Input: Partial update (JSON body similar to POST, fields optional).
Output: Updated property (200 OK).


DELETE /properties/{id}:

Input: Path param id.
Output: 204 No Content.


GET /properties:

Input (Query Params): page (int, default 1), limit (int, default 20).
Output: { "properties": [property objects], "total": int, "page": int, "limit": int }.



**Validation Rules**

Authentication: JWT required; role must be "host"; for updates/deletes, hostId must match authenticated user.
Required fields must be present; pricePerNight > 0; maxGuests >=1.
Location: Validate lat/lng ranges (-90 to 90, -180 to 180); address sanitized.
Amenities: Enum-limited to predefined list (e.g., from config).
Images: Validate file types (JPEG/PNG), size; upload to cloud storage asynchronously.
Availability: Dates in ISO format, no overlaps in array; future dates only.
Database constraints: Unique titles per host optional; foreign key to Users table.

**Performance Criteria**

Average response time: < 300ms for create/update (including image upload).
Throughput: 500 requests per minute; use queuing for image processing.
Scalability: Cache frequently accessed properties (Redis, TTL 5min); index Properties table on location/price for fast queries.
Security: RBAC enforcement; encrypt location data if sensitive.
Testing: Unit tests for validations; integration tests for DB interactions and cloud storage.

**3. Booking System**
This feature manages booking creation, cancellation, and status tracking, with date validation to prevent double bookings and integration with payments.
API Endpoints

POST /bookings: Create a new booking (guest only).
GET /bookings/{id}: Retrieve a specific booking.
PATCH /bookings/{id}/cancel: Cancel a booking (guest/host, per policy).
GET /bookings: List user's bookings (paginated).

Input/Output Specifications

POST /bookings:

Input (Request Body - JSON):
json{
  "propertyId": "uuid" (required),
  "startDate": "date" (required, ISO format),
  "endDate": "date" (required, ISO format),
  "numGuests": "integer" (required, min 1),
  "paymentInfo": "object" (required for upfront, { "method": "string" (e.g., "stripe"), "token": "string" })
}

Output (Response Body - JSON, 201 Created):
json{
  "id": "uuid",
  "propertyId": "uuid",
  "guestId": "uuid",
  "startDate": "date",
  "endDate": "date",
  "numGuests": "integer",
  "status": "string" (enum: ["pending", "confirmed", "canceled"]),
  "totalPrice": "number" (calculated),
  "paymentStatus": "string" (e.g., "paid")
}

Error Responses: 409 Conflict (dates unavailable).


GET /bookings/{id}:

Input: Path param id.
Output: Booking object (200 OK).


PATCH /bookings/{id}/cancel:

Input (Request Body - JSON): { "reason": "string" (optional) }.
Output: Updated booking with status "canceled" (200 OK).


GET /bookings:

Input (Query Params): page, limit, status (filter).
Output: Paginated list of bookings.



**Validation Rules**

Authentication: JWT required; guest for creation, guest/host for cancel (ownership check).
Dates: startDate < endDate, both future, no overlap with existing bookings (query Bookings DB).
NumGuests <= property.maxGuests (cross-check Properties table).
Payment: Validate token with gateway; support multiple currencies (convert via API).
Status transitions: Pending -> Confirmed on payment success; cancel only if policy allows (e.g., >48h before start).
Transactional: Use DB transactions to lock availability during creation.
Sanitization: Prevent injection; limit reason to 500 chars.

**Performance Criteria**

Average response time: < 500ms for creation (includes payment gateway call and DB transaction).
Throughput: 200 requests per minute; use optimistic locking for concurrency.
Scalability: Distributed transactions if scaled; cache availability calendars (Redis).
Security: Encrypt payment tokens; comply with PCI DSS for payments.
Testing: Integration tests for end-to-end flow (mock gateway); stress tests for concurrent bookings
